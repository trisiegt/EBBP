# Edge-Based Browser Project
## What is it?
The **Edge-Based Browser Project** is a simple web browser based on Microsoft Edge using ***"Microsoft.Web.WebView2"***. Can you *tell* I like Markdown?
The **Project**, as we will call it from now on, has a CONFIG.TXT file. This file can be used to control the default search engines and start pages. 
The best part is that it's MY creation!
It is tab-less as well, solely because Google Gemini (swear word)ed it up and I corrupted it only for it to come back?? Yeah, I have no idea either.

## Legal
Now, I ain't smart. But I slightly modified the MIT licence. What is it called? The MIT-**NC** licence. NC is standing for Non-Commercial, not North Carolina. Just saying.
Read the damn LICENCE file.
